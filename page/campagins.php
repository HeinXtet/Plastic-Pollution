        Earth Day Network is leveraging the platform of our 50th anniversary in 2020 and is working with key
        constituencies and influencers in building a world of educated consumers of all ages who understand the
        environmental, climate and health consequences of using plastics. We are engaging and activating our global
        network of NGOâ€™s and grassroots organizations, campus youth, mayors and other local elected leaders, faith
        leaders, artists and athletes, and primary and secondary students and teachers. We are also supporting events in
        all continents of the world, building a global following and activating citizens to join our End Plastic
        Pollution advocacy campaigns. In sum, we are using the power of Earth Day to elevate the issue of plastic
        pollution in the global agenda and inspiring and demanding effective action to reducing and controlling it.
